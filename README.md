# Digit Recognition with CNN and Pygame Interface

## Description

This project implements a digit recognition system using a __Convolutional Neural Network__ (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. It integrates a user-friendly Pygame interface that allows you to draw digits on a black canvas and receive real-time predictions from the model.

## MNIST Dataset

## Key Features

- __CNN-based Recognition:__ Leverages the power of CNNs to accurately recognize handwritten digits.
- __MNIST Dataset Integration:__ Utilizes the well-established MNIST dataset for training the CNN model.
- __Interactive Pygame Interface:__ Provides a user-friendly canvas for drawing digits using your mouse.
- __Real-time Predictions:__ Displays the predicted digit class alongside the drawn number and highlights it with a red boundary.

## Technologies used

- __Python__ (Core functionality, CNN development)
- __TensorFlow/Keras__ (Deep learning framework for CNN)
- __Pygame__ (Graphical user interface creation)
- __NumPy__ (Numerical computations)

# Disclaimer

This project is for educational and demonstrative purposes only. The accuracy of the model might vary depending on various factors.

## Further Development
- Enhance the user interface with features like clear button, prediction history, etc.
- Explore different CNN architectures or hyperparameter tunings for improved accuracy.
- Incorporate data augmentation techniques for a more robust model.
